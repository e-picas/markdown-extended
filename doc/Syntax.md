Markdown Extended syntax
========================

## Typography

### Bold

Bold text is written surrounded between 2 asterisks or underscores:

    **bolded content** or __bolded content__

Example: Some **bold text** with asterisks in a sentence, and __some more__ with underscores...

### Italic

Italic text is written surrounded between 1 asterisk or underscore:

    *italic content* or _italic content_

Example: Some *italic text* with asterisks in a sentence, and _some more_ with underscores...

### Auto-escaping of internal underscores

Internal underscores in emphasis are auto-escaped:

__my_underscored_bold_word__

Example: Some __underscored_bold_word__ auto-escaped.

### Code spans

A code span is written surrounded between 1 tick:

    `function()`

Example: A code `function()` in a sentence.


## Links

Links concerns full URL, relative paths or email addresses.

### Automatic links

Automatic link is written surrounding the link target between inferior and superior signs:

    <http://example.com/> and <address@email.com>

Example: A link <http://example.com/> and an email link <address@email.com> written in a sentence.

### Link notation

A full hypertext link is composed of two parts, the text of the link, surrounded between brackets, and the target URL, surrounded between parenthesis:

    [link text](http://example.com/ "Optional link title")

Example: This is my [link text](http://example.com/ "Optional link title") with an optional title.

### Referenced links

A referenced hypertext link is written replacing the second part of the notation above with a reference ID:

    [link text][myid]

and after the paragraph, anywhere in the document, the reference may be defined:

    [myid]: http://example.com/ "Optional link title"

Example: My [link text][myid] using a reference defined elsewhere.

A self-referenced link notation can also be used:

    [mylink][]

This will refer to a reference:

    [mylink]: http://example.com/ "Optional title" class=external rel=external

Example: [mylink][] and [mylink2][] and [mylink3][]

[mylink]: http://example.com/ "Optional title" class=external rel=external
[mylink2]: http://example.com/ "Optional title" class=external rel=external style="border: solid black 1px;"
[mylink3]: http://example.com/ "Optional title" class=external rel="external"
    style="border: solid black 1px;"

### In-page link

An inpage link is written replacing the target URL by the inpage hash:

    [link text](#anchor)

This will return to `# my title {#anchor}` in the document.

Example: A link to an anchor: [link text](#myanchor)

A self-reference link can also be used, written both parts of the link between brackets:

    [link text][anchor]

This will refer to `My text[anchor]` in the document.

Example: [link text][#mynewanchor] or [atitleanchor][]

## Images

### Inline notation

An embedded image is written like a link with a leading exclamation point:

    ![Alt text](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png "Optional image title")

Example: This may embed an image: ![Alt text](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png "Optional image title")

### Referenced images

A referenced embedded image is written just like a referenced link with a leading exclamation point:

    ![Alt text][myimageid]

and after the paragraph, anywhere in the document, the reference may be defined:

    [myimageid]: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png "Optional image title"

Example: This may embed an image ![iumage] [myimageid] referenced elsewhere.

You can use attributes:

    [myimageid]: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png "Optional image title" width=40 height=40

A self-referenced link image can also be used:

    [mylink][]

This will refer to reference `[mylink]: http://example.com/ "Optional title" class=external style="border: solid black 1px;"` anywhere in the document.

Example: ![my image][myimage]

[myid]: http://example.com/ "Optional link title"
[myimageid]: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png "Optional image title"
[atest]: http://myexample.com/ (Optional link title)
[myimage]: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png "Optional image title" width=40 height=40


## Lists

### Unordered lists

Begin each entry by an asterisk, a plus or an hyphen followed by 3 spaces

    -   first item
    *   second item
        - first sub-item
        * second sub-item
    -   third item

Example:

-   first item
*   second item
    - first sub-item
    * second sub-item
-   third item

### Ordered lists

Begin each entry by a number followed by a dot and 3 spaces

    1.   first item
    1.   second item
        1. first sub-item
        1. second sub-item
    2.   third item

Example:

1.   first item
1.   second item
    1. first sub-item
    1. second sub-item
2.   third item


## Blocks and structural elements

### Paragraph

To build a paragraph, just pass a line (example this line ...).

### Titles

Titles can use two notations, sharps:

    # my title level 1
    or
    ### my title level 3

or "sextet":

    my title 1
    ==========

    or

    my title 2
    ----------

### Pre-formatted contents

Begin lines with 4 spaces (example this block):

        pre formed content

Fenced code block can be written surrounded between lines of tildes (at least 3):

    ~~~~
    My code here
    ~~~~

Example:

~~~~
My code here
~~~~

You can specify an information about the language following the first tildes by the language name (without space):

    ~~~~html
    My code here
    ~~~~

Example:

~~~~html
My code here
~~~~

### Blockquotes and citations

To write a citation, begin your lines by '>':

    > my citation

Example:

> My citation
>
> With a paragraph and some `code`
>
>     and even a preformatted string

Adding a reference URL to blockquote:

    > (http://example.com) this is my citation extracted from the content
    > of the page at http://example.com URL

Example:

> (http://example.com) this is my citation extracted from the content
> of the page at http://example.com URL

### Horizontal rules

Horizontal rule can be written with 3 or more hyphens, asterisks or underscores on a line:

    ----

Example:

----


## Definitions

A definition is written in at least two parts, the term and the definition, with leading double-points:

    Apple
    :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
        the family Rosaceae.

Example:

Term 1
:   This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus.

:   Second definition for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
    because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2
:   This definition has a code block, a blockquote and a list.

        code block.

    > block quote
    > on two lines.

    1.  first list item
    2.  second list item


## Abbreviations

An abbreviation is written like a reference, anywhere in the document, with a leading sterisk:

    *[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language

Example: A text with HTML expression.

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language

*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium


## Tables

A table:

    | First Header  | Second Header |
    | ------------- | ------------: |
    | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
    | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

or (without leading pipe) :

## Notes

### Footnotes

A footnote:

    That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

    [^1]: And that's the footnote.

Example: That's some[^2] text with three footnotes.[^1][^3]

[^1]: And that's the first footnote.

    That's the second paragraph.

[^2]: And that's another footnote (the second)
    on *two lines* for test ...

[^3]: And that's a footnote [with a link](http://example.com).

### Citation notes

Citations : like footnote begining by a sharp

    This is a statement that should be attributed to
    its source[p. 23][#Doe:2006].

    And following is the description of the reference to be
    used in the bibliography.

    [#Doe:2006]: John Doe. *Some Big Fancy Book*.  Vanity Press, 2006.

Example:

This is a statement that should be attributed to
its source[p. 23][#Doe:2006].

And following is the description of the reference to be
used in the bibliography.

[#Doe:2006]: John Doe. *Some Big Fancy Book*.  Vanity Press, 2006.

### Glossary notes

Glossary footnotes :

    [^glossaryfootnote]: glossary: term (optional sort key)
        The actual definition belongs on a new line, and can continue on
        just as other footnotes.

Example:

My text with a footnote ref [^glossaryfootnote].

[^glossaryfootnote]: glossary: term (2)
    The actual definition belongs on a new line, and can continue on
    just as other footnotes.


## Inline HTML

This is a regular paragraph.

<table border="2px" cellspacing="2px" cellpadding="6px">
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
        <td>*Foo*</td>
        <td>`Foo`</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This is another regular paragraph, with another call of footnote 2 [^2].

Below is the same table as above with argument `markdown="1"`.

<table border="2px" cellspacing="2px" cellpadding="6px" markdown="1">
<tr>
    <td>Foo</td>
    <td>*Foo*</td>
    <td>`Foo`</td>
</tr>
</table>

This is another regular paragraph.


## Mathematics

Mathematics in MDE can be written following the [LATEX](http://www.latex-project.org/) rules.

For HTML transformation, you may use [MathJAX](http://www.mathjax.org/) in your templates.

### Inline maths

Inline mathematics are written surrounded like `\(...\)`:

    where \(\alpha = (t_1 - t_0)/L\) is the rate at which the thickness increases

Example: where \(\alpha = (t_1 - t_0)/L\) is the rate at which the thickness increases

### Maths blocks

Maths blocks are built surrounded like `\[...\]`:

    Putting this into Castigliano's equation, we get

    \[\Delta = \frac{\partial U^*}{\partial F} = \frac{12F}{Eb} \int_0^L \frac{x^2}{(t_0 + \alpha x)^3} dx\]

Example:

Putting this into Castigliano's equation, we get

\[\Delta = \frac{\partial U^*}{\partial F} = \frac{12F}{Eb} \int_0^L \frac{x^2}{(t_0 + \alpha x)^3} dx\]
