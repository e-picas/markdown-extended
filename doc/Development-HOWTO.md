PHP MarkdownExtended development HOW TO
====

If you want to contribute to the sources of this project, you are very welcome ;)
This documentation file will introduce you the "dev-cycle" of PHP MarkdownExtended.

First of all, you may do the following two things:

-   read the *How to contribute* section below to learn about forking, working and pulling,
-   from your fork of the repository, switch to the `dev` branch: this is where the dev things are done.


### How to contribute ?

If you want to correct a typo or update a feature of PHP MarkdownExtended, the first thing to do is
[create your own fork of the repository](http://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
You will need a (free) GitHub account to do this and your copy will appear in your forks list.
This is on THIS repository (your own fork) that you will work (you have no right to make 
direct `push` on the original repository).

Once your work seems finished, you'll have to commit it and push it on your fork (you may 
finally see your modifications on the sources view on GitHub). Then you'll have to make a 
"pull-request" to the original repository, commenting it with a description of your correction or
update, or anything you want me to know about ... Then, if your work seems ok for me 
(and it certainly will :) and when I'll have the time (!), your work will finally be 
"merged" in the original repository and you will be able to (eventually) close your fork. 
Note that the "merge" of a pull-request keeps your name and profile as the "commiter" 
(the one who made the stuff).

**BEFORE** you start a work on the code, please check that this has NOT been done yet, or part
of it, by giving a look at <http://github.com/e-picas/markdown-extended/pulls>. If you 
find a pull-request that seems to be like the modification you were going to do, you can 
comment the request with your vision of the thing or your experience.


### Full installation of a fork

To prepare a development version of PHP MarkdownExtended, clone your fork of the repository and
put it on the "dev" branch:

    git clone http://github.com/<your-username>/markdown-extended.git
    cd markdown-extended
    git checkout dev

Then you can create your own branch with the name of your feature:

    git checkout -b <my-branch>

The development process of the package requires some external dependencies to work, loaded via
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install them, run:

    // install Composer if you don't have it
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

    // install PHP dependencies
    php composer.phar install

Your clone is ready ;)

You can *synchronize* your fork with current original repository by defining a remote to it
and pulling new commits:

    // create an "upstream" remote to the original repo
    git remote add upstream http://github.com/e-picas/markdown-extended.git

    // get last original remote commits
    git checkout dev
    git pull upstream dev


### Development life-cycle

As said above, all development MUST be done on the `dev` branch of the repository. Doing so we
can commit our development features to let users using a clone test and improve them.

When the work gets a stable stage, it seems to be time to build and publish a new release. This
is done by creating a tag named like `vX.Y.Z[-status]` from the "master" branch after having
merged the "dev" one in. Please see the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) work by 
Tom Preston-Werner for more info about the release version name construction rules.


How-tos
-------

All the dependencies used here are installed as "dev-dependencies" by Composer running:

    $ php composer.phar install --dev

### Generate the "PHAR" archive

To automatically re-generate the "markdown-extended.phar" file from current version, you can use:

    $ php bin/mde-dev make-phar

The archive's content can be extracted and check running:

    $ php bin/mde-dev check-phar

### Generate the man-page

To automatically re-generate the manpages of the package, you can use:

    $ php bin/mde-dev make-manpage-3
    $ php bin/mde-dev make-manpage-7
    $ php bin/mde-dev make-manpages    # this will run both

To generate them manually, you can run:

    $ bin/markdown-extended -f man -o bin/markdown-extended.3.man doc/MANPAGE.md
    $ man ./bin/markdown-extended.3.man
    $ bin/markdown-extended -f man -o bin/markdown-extended.7.man doc/DOCUMENTATION.md
    $ man ./bin/markdown-extended.7.man

### Check dependencies

The package is integrated in [Version Eye](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/550e3650bc1c12efc3000067)
to check if its dependencies are up-to-date.

### Generate the documentation

The app's API documentation is generated with [Sami](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami).

You can (re-)generate a full PHP documentation, at any time, running:

    $ php bin/sami.php update .sami.php

The documentation is built in the `phpdoc/` directory in the package, and requires a temporary
directory for its generation that is configured on `../tmp/cache/markdown-extended/`.
You can modify this setting editing the `.sami.php` file.

You can also use the Composer's script shortcut:

    php composer.phar update-doc

### Launch unit-tests

The unit-testing of the app is handled with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).

You can verify that your package passes all tests running:

    $ php bin/phpunit

All tests are stored in the `tests/` directory of the package and
the configuration file used by PHPUnit is `phpunit.xml.dist` at the root
of the package.

Note that the package is integrated in [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/e-picas/markdown-extended/builds).

You can also use the Composer's script shortcut:

    php composer.phar test

### Fix coding standards errors

You can check and fix code writing errors using [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)
by running:

    $ php bin/php-cs-fixer fix -v

This tool loads and uses the `.php_cs` configuration file by default.

You can also use the Composer's script shortcut:

    php composer.phar cs-fixer

### Mess detection & code quality

App's code "mess" can be tested with [PHP Mess Detector](http://phpmd.org/).

You can check code mess running:

    $ php bin/phpmd src text codesize

Note that the package is integrated in [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/e-picas/markdown-extended).

### Make a new release

To make a new release of the package, you must follow these steps:

1.  merge the "dev" branch into "master"

        git checkout master
        git merge --no-ff --no-commit dev

2.  fix code standards errors:

        php composer.phar cs-fixer

3.  validate unit-tests:

        php composer.phar tests

4.  bump new version number and commit:

        php bin/mde-dev make-release --release=X.Y.Z-SATE

5.  update the changelog ; you can use <https://github.com/atelierspierrot/atelierspierrot/blob/master/console/git-changelog.sh>.

6.  commit changes:

        git commit -a -m "preparing release X.Y.Z-STATE"

7.  create the release tag and publish it:

        git tag -a vX.Y.Z-STATE -m "new release ..."
        git push origin vX.Y.Z-STATE

8.  build new PHAR archive and publish it into the "phar-latest" branch:

        php bin/mde-dev make-phar
        git checkout phar-latest
        rm -f bin/markdown-extended.phar && mv markdown-extended.phar bin/
        git commit -a -m "new X.Y.Z-STATE phar"

9.  merge "master" into "dev":

        git checkout dev
        git merge --no-ff master

Finally, don't forget to push all changes to `origin` and to make a release page
on GitHub's repository. The best practice is to attach the PHAR archive to the release.

Coding rules
------------

You MUST follow the [PHP Standard Recommendations](http://www.php-fig.org/).

Always keep in mind the followings:

-   use space (no tab) ; 1 tab = 4 spaces ; this is valid for all languages
-   comment your work (just enough)
-   in case of error in a PHP script, ALWAYS throw one of the `MarkdownExtended\Exception`s with a message
