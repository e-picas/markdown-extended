Contribute to PHP MarkdownExtended
====

If you want to contribute to this project, you are very welcome ;)
This documentation file will introduce you the "dev-cycle" of PHP MarkdownExtended.


Inform about a bug or request for a new feature
-----------------------------------------------

### Bug ticketing

A bug is a *demonstrable problem caused by the code* (and not due to a special user behaviour).
Bugs are inevitable and exist in all software. If you find one and want to transmit it, first
**it is very helpful** as it will participate to build a robust software.

But ... a bug report is helpful as long as it can be understood, reproduced, and that it permits to
identify the error (and what caused it). A good bug report MUST follow these guidelines:

-   **first**: search in the issue tracker if your bug has not been transmitted yet ; if you find an existing one,
    you can add a new comment to the appropriate thread with your experience if it seems different
    from the others ;
-   **then**: check if it exists right now: try to reproduce it with the current code to confirm it still exists ;
-   if you **finally** create a bug ticket, try to detail it as much as possible:
    -   what is your environment (application version, OS, device ...)?
    -   describe and comment the steps that brought you to that bug
    -   try to isolate the problem as much as possible
    -   what did you expect?


### Feature requests

If you want to ask for a new feature, please follow these guidelines:

-   the goal of this project is to be (and keep) relevant for a large public ; maybe your request
    is quite personal (you have a particular need) and can be discussed with me by email ; in this
    case please do not make a feature request (!)
-   if you think something is missing or have an idea to increase one of PHP MarkdownExtended's features, then
    you are ready for a "feature request" ; you can create an issue ticket beginning its name by
    "feature request: " ; please detail your request or your idea as much as possible, with a lot 
    of your experience.


Actually change the code
------------------------

You can find a developer documenatation in the file [doc/Development-HOWTO.md](./doc/Development-HOWTO.md).
